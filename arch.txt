#instal pm-utils for suspend/hibernate functionality
1. Install pm-utils
2. Install vbetool and acpi(need them for pm-utils to work)
3. Standby/Suspend to RAM should be imidiatelly enabled with
   sudo pm-suspend command
4. Standby/Suspend to disk (Hibernation) needs some additional   configuration: 
	4.1 add to /boot/grub/menu.lst (config file for grub1)
	    'resume=/path/to/swap/drive' (/dev/sda5 on my mac
	    since /dev/sda3 is /boot partition and /dev/sda4
	    is linux main partition)
	    the kernel line in the next paragraph is changed:

		title  Arch Linux
		root   (hd0,2)
		kernel /vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda4 ro
		initrd /initramfs-linux.img
	    
	   as follows: 
	        kernel /vmlinuz-linux root/dev/sda4 resume=/dev/sda5 ro

	4.2 resume hook should be added to 
            /etc/mkinitcpio.conf in the following line:
		HOOKS="base udev autodetect ide scsi sata lvm2 resume filesystems "
            it is important to place resume after ide,scisi, 	          sata and lvm2 and before filesystems.
	    After this edit recreate linux image by: 

	    	'mkinitcpio -p linux' command
	 
	4.3 set user permissions for pm-utils in 
	    /etc/sudoers as follows:

	    	<username> <hostname>=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/pm-hibernate, /usr/sbin/pm-suspend
	    	(replace <username> and <hostname> with 
	         acctual values)
	4.4. Add aliases in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc 

	     	alias hibernate="sudo pm-hibernate"
	     	alias suspend="sudo pm-suspend"

	     and you are good to go! happy hacking.
